graph representation using set and hash

Pros: Queries like whether there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v can be done in O(log V).
Cons: 

Adding an edge takes O(log V), as opposed to O(1) in vector implementation.
Graphs containing parallel edge(s) cannot be implemented through this method.
Further Optimization of Edge Search Operation using unordered_set (or hashing): 
The edge search operation can be further optimized to O(1) using unordered_set which uses hashing internally.
