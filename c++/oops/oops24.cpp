// C++ Polymorphism
// The term "Polymorphism" is the combination of "poly" + "morphs" which means many forms. It is a greek word. In object-oriented programming, we use 3 main concepts: inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

// Real Life Example Of Polymorphism
// Let's consider a real-life example of polymorphism. A lady behaves like a teacher in a classroom, mother or daughter in a home and customer in a market. Here, a single person is behaving differently according to the situations.

It is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading which is also known as static binding or early binding. Now, let's consider the case where function name and prototype is same
